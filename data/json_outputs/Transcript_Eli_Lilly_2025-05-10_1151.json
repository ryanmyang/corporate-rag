    "content": "Q1 was another exciting quarter. We increased our revenue, advanced our pipeline, invested to drive future growth, and shared the first Phase 3 clinical data from our oral GLP-1, orforglipron. These data met our expectations and are the first steps to delivering our overall goal for the program, which is to create a medicine that offers injectable GLP-1 like efficacy, safety, and tolerability, with the convenience of a once daily pill. Revenue grew 45% compared to Q1 of 2024. Our key products grew by more than $4 billion and now account for $7.5 billion of revenue for the company. We achieved several key pipeline milestones this quarter, including the approval of Jaypirca in the EU for CLL and the approval of Omvoh in the US, EU and Japan for Crohn's disease. We also distributed $1.3 billion in dividends in the first quarter and executed a $1.2 billion share repurchase."

    "content": "Q1 was another strong quarter of financial performance with revenue growing 45% compared to Q1 2024, driven by our key products. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 83.5% in Q1, an increase of 1 percentage point versus the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 26% as we invested in promotional activities to support new launches. In Q1, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $1.57 billion, primarily related to the acquisition of Scorpion Therapeutics. Our non-GAAP performance margin was 42.6%, an increase of over 11 percentage points from Q1 2024. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $3.34 in Q1, compared to earnings per share of $2.58 in Q1 2024."

    "content": "I'll start with key data from our recently completed orforglipron Phase 3 trial. The results from the ACHIEVE-1 trial support our hypothesis that orforglipron could deliver efficacy, safety and tolerability similar to the best seen for available GLP-1 monotherapy injectables. In this 40-week monotherapy study, patients on the two highest doses ended the study with a mean A1c of about 6.5%. More than 65% of patients achieved an A1c less than or equal to 6.5%. In a key secondary endpoint, orforglipron also helped people with diabetes lose approximately 16 pounds or 7.9% of their body weight at the highest dose."

    "content": "Q: Dave, just in light of the CVS formulary announcement this morning, favoring the Wegovy over Zepbound, what is your expectation on market share dynamics in the next weeks and months from the CVS formulary loss? A: We're not surprised that this kind of thing was announced. If we look at what's happening in the market, we're pretty deep into a replacement cycle, particularly on obesity and Tirzepatide is gaining a lot of market share. Our focus is on making better medicines and more accessible medicines."

    "content": "Q: When you look at the positioning of orforglipron, is the ultimate goal to have meaningfully more indications than Tirzepatide just given the oral convenience? A: Oral medicine like orforglipron could be acceptable for use in a number of broad indications, particularly primary care type indications. We have even more confidence in this molecule and we'll aggressively pursue whatever directions we think work."

Approximately 50% of patients have a preference for an oral, and we can scale and reach patients that is more or less impossible with only injectables."
